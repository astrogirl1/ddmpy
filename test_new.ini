---> By setting ncdm_fluid_approximation to 2, we switch-on the fluid approximation for the NCDM species, including the 
WDM daughter. This approximation is activated for sub-Hubble scales k*tau>>1, the variable ncdm_fluid_trigger_tau_over_tau_k 
gives the value of k*tau at which we want to activate the fluid equations
If you want to change the full hierarchy calculation, then you should set ncdm_fluid_approximation to 3, comment the line with
ncdm_fluid_trigger_tau_over_tau_k, and increase the Number of momentum bins perturbs from 300 to some higher value (at least 1000).
